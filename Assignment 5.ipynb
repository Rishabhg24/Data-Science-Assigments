Proper memory management helps Python automatically allocate memory when creating objects and free it when those objects are no longer needed, which optimizes performance and resource usage. This is especially critical in long-running programs or applications handling large amounts of data, where unmanaged memory could lead to degraded system performance or failures. Overall, effective memory management makes Python programs more reliable, faster, and easier to maintain."

        "      * Improved Responsiveness\n",
