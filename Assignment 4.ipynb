A @staticmethod is essentially a regular function placed inside a class’s namespace — it does not receive any implicit first argument, meaning it cannot access or modify the class state or instance data. It behaves like a plain function but is logically grouped within the class for organization or convenience. In contrast, a @classmethod receives the class itself (cls) as its first argument, which allows it to access and modify class-level data or call other class methods. This makes class methods useful for factory methods that create instances in alternative ways or for methods that need to work with the class as a whole rather than any particular instance. While both can be called on the class or instance, @classmethod is aware of the class context, whereas @staticmethod is not."

        "    - Polymorphism in Python with inheritance allows objects of different subclasses to be treated as instances of their parent class, while still exhibiting behavior specific to their own subclass. This works because subclasses can override methods defined in the parent class, and when a method is called on a parent class reference, Python uses dynamic method dispatch (also called runtime polymorphism) to invoke the subclass's version of the method. Essentially, the exact method that gets executed depends on the actual type of the object, not the reference type. This lets you write flexible and reusable code that can operate on a general class type but behave differently depending on the specific subclass object passed in.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example :- if you have a base class Animal with a method speak(), and subclasses like Dog and Cat that each override speak(), calling speak() on an Animal reference to a Dog or Cat object will produce different results based on the subclass implementation. This dynamic behavior is a core advantage of polymorphism combined with inheritance in Python."
